Powershell script to copy files based on shortcuts
===================================

From the source directory, find all shortcuts, and copy the shortcut contents to a destination directory

Run
------------

Right click on _copy_shortcut_contents.ps1 and choose Run with Powershell


Usage
-----
Open _copy_shortcut_contents.ps1 and edit the options
```
# options 
$opts = @{
    # only output what would happen, dont actually copy anything
    dryrun = 1

    # where to copy from; full path; end with slash
    # use current dir as srcDir
    # srcDir = $scriptPath + "\"
    # srcDir = "C:\Temp\"
    srcDir = $scriptPath + "\testdirs\"

    # where to copy to; full path; end with slash
    # destDir = "T:\"
    destDir = $scriptPath + "\testdirs\testdest\"

    # 1 (recommended) - use dos copy to get progress per file; 0 - use copy-item
    useCopyProgress = 1

    # 1 - if a sub dest path exists, skip; 0 (recommended) - re-check files, maybe new, in sub dest paths
    skipExistingDestPath = 0

    # 1 (recommended) - if dest file exists, skip; 0 - re-copy
    skipExistingDestFile = 1

    # 1 - show existing files; 0 (recommended) - don't show, reducing output
    showExistingFiles = 0
}
```

### Known issues
* If you run the script in Windows Terminal, the history of the write-host output will be lost to the Write-Progress.  Workaround: run the script in native PowerShell, or update Windows Terminal -> Settings -> Default terminal application -> to Window Console Host eg not Windows Terminal  
* shortcuts are only processed from one dir, not recursively; However, the shortcuts target folder contents are recursively copied 
* running local PowerShell scripts requires updating your PowerShell security policy
  * Run PowerShell as Admin
  * Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned  

    The execution policies you can use are:  
    * **Restricted** - Scripts wonâ€™t run.  
    * **RemoteSigned** - Scripts created locally will run, but those downloaded from the Internet will not (unless they are digitally signed by a trusted publisher).  
    * **AllSigned** - Scripts will run only if they have been signed by a trusted publisher.  
    * **Unrestricted** - Scripts will run regardless of where they have come from and whether they are signed.
